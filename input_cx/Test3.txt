SPEAKER_05
69.65--76.9
 Wow, that's amazing. So if there's any way to take that one off.
SPEAKER_06
76.9--82.5

SPEAKER_06
104.95--114.9
 Awesome, that sounds like a good deal. I'd be more than happy to help you out with that, Mr. Yunkwith. So do you by any chance have the trip ID number for the trip that was cancelled?

SPEAKER_05
130.85--149.3
 Oh, yeah. Let's see here. And the trip ID was the one where â€“ like, the initial one that was set up, like, the first time kind of thing.
SPEAKER_06
149.55--154.8

SPEAKER_06
215.55--218.6
 Is this the only book you were calling about today?
SPEAKER_05
