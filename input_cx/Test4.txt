 Cool.
SPEAKER_00
223.65--227.7
 to ms lewiswood airport where which airline were you looking to fly with
SPEAKER_02
230.05--233.9
 I wanted to find out what the rates were and what would be the best deal.
SPEAKER_00
233.9--269.6
 Okay, so it's all depending on what time you would like to leave. So of course the best rates would be later at night around 816 p.m. But if you wanted to leave earlier in the day, the next best rate would be 220 p.m. And that's with Delta Airlines and these are non-stop flights. They will be 21,000 points each. So it would be for two people about when. And that's all depending on when you would like to return. It would range from 40,000 to 50,000.
SPEAKER_02
269.6--270.8
 That's round trip, right?
SPEAKER_00
271.15--272.8
 Yep, 40,000.
SPEAKER_02
272.8--277.2
 21,000 is round trip for one, correct?
SPEAKER_00
277.2--279.4
 Yeah, so for two, it would be about 43.
SPEAKER_02
281.05--283.8
 for two round trips.
SPEAKER_00
283.95--291.9
 And that's only if you wanted to pick your seating. If you didn't want to pick your seating, it'll be 40,000. It'll be lower.
SPEAKER_02
294.05--301.2
 Oh, you mean, okay. I don't, yeah, I don't care.
SPEAKER_00
301.2--338.1
 Let me see here on your return. So that would be leaving out of MSP at 2.20 PM, arriving in Washington at 5.45 PM. Okay, and that's with Delta Airlines. And for your price to stay the same, you would have to leave either at 7.38 AM or 7.30 AM or the lowest would be 3.22 PM.
SPEAKER_02
341.65--344.1
 3 22 PM that's on the 8th.
SPEAKER_00
344.1--350.3
 Yes ma'am on your return so you would have to leave at $322 or $7 to keep that pricing in the same area.
SPEAKER_02
352.55--354.4
 or 7 a.m or p.m.
SPEAKER_00
354.65--355.8
 a.m. a.m.
SPEAKER_02
356.85--359.7
 I would choose 322.
SPEAKER_00
361.55--369.9
 So yep, 3.22 PM, you would arrive from DC-8, leaving at 3.22 PM, getting into MSP at 5.13.
SPEAKER_02
373.05--373.8
 Okay.
SPEAKER_00
373.95--378.2
 and this will be a total of 40,960 points.
SPEAKER_02
381.15--385.0
 Okay, but none of those can be the ones that are about to expire apparently
SPEAKER_00
385.65--398.8
 Yep, they will be. They will be all. So if you use, since 30,000 expired today, it was all 30,000 will go to this trip and you will use 10,000 new points. So yeah, you won't have to worry about those if you did book this today.
SPEAKER_02
399.65--404.1
 Okay, I'm not sure it was exactly 30, but it was approximately 30.
SPEAKER_00
404.55--422.3
 Okay, approximately, and that's okay. And if you, I'll get you connected with your card member services, and if they say, oh, you have more than 30,000, you can just say, oh, can you apply those points that are expiring towards my bill? And they'll change it and change that into cash and pay your credit card bill with it.
SPEAKER_02
424.15--424.8
 Okay.
SPEAKER_00
425.95--443.3

SPEAKER_02
751.7--755.4
 No, no misery. No, we've got a little time.
SPEAKER_00
756.15--768.2
 Wonderful, wonderful, Miss Lewis. But we got everything taken care of for you. Of course, these are not refundable tickets. All baggage fees will be due with the airlines since we do not associate with them.
SPEAKER_02
768.2--768.9
 on the ball.
SPEAKER_00
769.05--782.1
 Yes, they're non-refundable tickets. So if you do want to change anything, Ms. Lewis, if you do it within 24 hours, you call us, okay? And we can make that change for you. But anytime after that, they're non-refundable, okay?

802.75--810.2
 This is the number to call. Okay, okay another question. What is your, what are your COVID requirements?
SPEAKER_00
810.85--821.8
 Um, they do leave based on airline. You should as long as you bring a mask. You don't have to wear them sometimes. It's all depending on where you're headed. So I would say bring a mask just in case, but you don't have to have anything else.
SPEAKER_02
823.75--831.5
 Yeah, I mean you can't wear it if you're eating, but there isn't much to eat on the plane anyway. Yeah, not a big deal.
SPEAKER_00
831.5--835.7
 or drink. Or drink. Yeah, the drink's a whore.
SPEAKER_02
835.7--863.6
 I had one more question, just let me think what it is. You still have the same rules about baggage and what you can bring on, how many pieces of baggage you can bring on the plane and how many need to be kept.
SPEAKER_00
863.6--871.7
 Yes, ma'am, same rules. If you wanted to pay for additional baggages, fees, they're about $35 to $40. But yeah, it's usually one check bag.
SPEAKER_02
872.75--879.5
 Please check one bag and you can take a handbag and another backpack or something off with you.
SPEAKER_00
879.5--881.3
 Yep, that's usually how it is
SPEAKER_02
882.25--890.3
 Okay. Okay. So you're going to transfer me to somebody else now, right?
SPEAKER_00
890.3--903.9
 Yes, ma'am, Ms. Lewis, so they can give you that value on points that can expire. And if they say, hey, 30,000 points expire, well, you know, you just use 40,000 a day. So you'll be fine if it's anything under 40,000 points. OK.
SPEAKER_02
903.9--909.0
 Yeah, I'm sure it's under 40,000 and they will know what to do, right?
SPEAKER_00
909.45--915.9
 Yep, they will know that because it's already I already took those 30,000 points like they're gone like you're good. So
SPEAKER_02
915.9--916.5
 Okay.
SPEAKER_00
916.65--922.6
 Yeah, like so if they tell you anything like oh you have to spend thirty thousand you're already spent them. So you're okay
SPEAKER_02
922.6--930.3
 Okay, if it turns out to be left, then they'll take care of that too. I think I got it about right. Oh yeah, you got it. Thank you.
