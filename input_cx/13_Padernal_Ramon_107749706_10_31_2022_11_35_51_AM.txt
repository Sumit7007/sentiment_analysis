Now, it is still on the 19th that you will be departing, and we'll still be leaving New York at 1250 a.m. However, instead of just a 14-hour, 25-minute flight to Seoul, it will be 15 hours and 55 minutes, which means you will arrive in Seoul by 645 a.m., okay? And that layover will be 12 hours still. Oh, will be 12 hours. You will leave. Hold on. Yeah. You will leave Seoul at 645 the following day, arriving in Hanoi, Vietnam at 940 p.m. And, yeah, 940 p.m. will be your arrival time from Seoul, Korea. Now, instead of 11, 1110 a.m. So, that's just for the departure, though. And for the return, actually, the return is okay. The only change on the return is the type of airplane that you will be riding on from Seoul back to New York, which instead of the Boeing 777-300, it will be an Airbus A380-800 passenger. But, sir, that missed your, yeah. About the changes on the departure flight, will you, is this still acceptable for you?
