SPEAKER_02
169.75--190.5
 I understand. Let me go ahead and check and see what we can do when we're going to check how much will be the remaining value of the ticket and let's see.

 Hi Ali, my name is Francis. I am one of your co-travel help desk agents from the Ultimate Rewards. I have Ms. Caroline Harris here who is calling in to cancel her return flight. So this is a partially used ticket and looking if she can check or have a travel credit once we cancel the return flight of her reservation. However, Ali, right now, my workspan is still deactivated or unable to access so I'm still waiting for the feedback about it. So I get permission to ask assistance to another help desk with the sedative.
