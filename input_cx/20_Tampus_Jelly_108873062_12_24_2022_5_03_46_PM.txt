SPEAKER_00
14.9--43.3
 Wonderful, Miss Park. Can you verify your billing zip code? Thanks so much. How about your best call back number? Wonderful. Do you have the consent to call you back in case a call gets corrupted? Sure. Alright. This is your Chase of Fire Reserve currently with 133,467 Chase Automotive Water Points Balance. I'm happy today.
SPEAKER_01
44.15--83.1
 Hi, I'd like to cancel Southwest Airlines and whenever I purchase Southwest Airlines and cancel, they guarantee me to give me the whole credit within one year of use. But this time I purchased with Sapphire Reserve Point and then I'd like to cancel it and then I'm hoping for that you guys are not giving. I'd like to get a travel credit, like Southwest provides.
SPEAKER_00
84.55--90.0
 You would like to cancel the booking today and you'd like to get a flight credit the same?
SPEAKER_01
90.0--105.2
 Yes, if you guys can give us a slight credit, I would like to cancel. And then every time when I book with directly with the Southwest airline, when I cancel, they give us full credit. Yes.
SPEAKER_01
106.05--108.5
 I don't want to have any people on the road with you guys.
SPEAKER_00
108.5--119.3
 Yes, sure. I'll make sure the track policy first with Southwest Airlines in here. By the way, for me to locate the exact location, you have the track ID? Sure.
SPEAKER_01
119.3--157.1
 Mine is... I don't see a rhymo. I'm just... I'm just trying to figure out what rhymo is.
SPEAKER_00
157.1--173.7
 Thank you so much. Let me go ahead and check the one. This is with Southwest Airlines from Miami to Midway this coming December 27. You mentioned you wanted to cancel the booking. This is for two passengers.
SPEAKER_01
175.05--189.0
 Uh-huh, because my daughter had a car accident recently and then she snapped well. So we don't want to go forward to the other day and spend more time instead of that we want to go back home directly.
SPEAKER_00
189.0--208.7
 I have to hear that Ms. Park. Hopefully your daughter is okay right now. Thank you. Yes. Let me check the policy of Southwest. I'll go back to you. Okay? Please just go and hold two or three minutes. Thank you.
SPEAKER_02
209.65--332.5
 You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold. You are on hold.
SPEAKER_00
335.05--366.4
 much for holding this part as per checking on your ticket that is the one I get away which is the most restrictive ticket they won't allow any cancellation you'll get or the ticket will be for a fee that if you'd like to cancel but in the event that you'd like to cancel due to your daughter is having a concussion yeah yeah there is medical issues right yes
SPEAKER_01
366.4--407.8
 Without medical issue also, she has a medical issue, but without medical issue, as a Chase Sapphire customer, you guys are letting us to purchase through points and then we use your service. And then since we purchased through your points, we are getting different service because if I purchase through Southwest Airlines, we always get a full, not refund, but we can use as a credit. Because if I purchase with you guys, then we cannot get any kind of credit.
SPEAKER_00
407.8--422.0
 For that one, if the ticket is the most restrictive one, where in cancellation is not permitted, this is the most standard policy that we follow.
SPEAKER_01
422.0--434.8
 Yeah, but if I purchase same ticket, one getaway or one away, that kind of ticket with Southwest Airlines, we still get our full credit.
SPEAKER_00
434.8--455.4
 This is also, this is as a policy that is provided to us coming from the Southwest, but then again it depends on the reason. We might contact the airline to ask exemption. It depends on the reason why you can't sell the booking because.
SPEAKER_01
455.4--468.8
 I have a police report and then police wrote down that they recommend my daughter to get an ambulance, those kind of papers with me. So I would appreciate it if you contact them.
SPEAKER_00
469.25--469.6
 Thank you.
SPEAKER_01
469.65--470.4
 It is a qua-
SPEAKER_00
470.4--472.3
 Spots resident, right? Yes.
SPEAKER_00
473.35--535.5
 Okay. Okay. All right, so, our Help Desk team is the only one who can contact directly the Southwest. It takes a process because they may ask you, for example, that the police report, the medical documents, for them to process the cancellation, but still subject for approval. Okay, so if they, airline will contacting the airline, if they will approve that we will cancel your booking, you will get a flight credit back, or what is the offer, since it depends, again, it depends on the reason why you wanted to cancel, because what I'm showing on the ticket, it's showing here that they will, cancellation is not permitted unless it is, like for example, in the event of death of the family or hospitalization. Okay, so.
SPEAKER_01
535.5--573.6
 We purchased from Cancun to Fort Lauderdale and then we were able to cancel with JetBlue. And you can see from my section, I already made a cancellation with it. And then they also provided cancellation and then canceled by today because tomorrow my hotel will be also not refundable. I have a hotel at Fort Lauderdale but I need to cancel within several hours.
SPEAKER_00
574.15--574.6
 Anyone?
SPEAKER_01
575.45--612.6
 Yes. Okay. And then I didn't know that purchasing tickets with you guys are more restriction and then much worse benefits with us because we are originally, if I purchase directly with Southwest, we can get a full credit, but with you guys, we cannot get a full credit. This is not correct. We have to know that and then you need to change it. Why we, when we use Southwest Direct channel, then we can get a full credit, but with you guys, why we cannot.
SPEAKER_01
613.25--613.3
 you
SPEAKER_00
613.3--622.9
 I don't. I don't. We have, yeah, they have also provided us this policy, this is a standard policy that we are basing on. No, no, no.
SPEAKER_01
622.9--662.1
 I call them and then they say they are willing to give us full credit. They told me. But they told me to contact, yeah, they told me to contact with Chase Bank. We are able to give you full credit. But if they say no, then no. But they are willing to give us full credit because before I knew that this was going to happen, so I already prepared for that. They said yes, so I made a reservation and then I didn't know that Chase Bank is the one who doesn't want to give us back any kind of credit.
SPEAKER_00
662.1--678.7
 This is the reason why we need to call the airline Miss Park. Okay, so we need a confirmation here and we cannot directly cancel the booking for a restrictive fare. Other options we will call the airline. Alright, yeah, maybe other things here.
SPEAKER_01
678.7--693.7
 Yes, I know this is restricted fare, but even this restricted fare, we still get full credit with the Southwest Airlines. If I get it, it's directly to the Southwest.
SPEAKER_00
693.7--745.6
 Ms. Clark, I totally understand. So for us to continue, please allow us, please allow me to transfer this call directly to help the Steve and for a further assistance.
