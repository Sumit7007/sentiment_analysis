How are you? I'm okay. Thanks. How are you? Oh, that's good to hear. I'm also good. Thank you for asking. And, Beverly, how may I help you today? Yeah, I've spoken with a number of people about this trip that got diverted, but I booked through the portal and we were owed some compensation and refunds and we have not been able to get it through Lufthansa, so we're hoping you can help us. All right. Sorry about that. Nothing to worry. I will try my best to help you. But first, I need to verify your account. Can I have your 16-digit card number, please? Yeah. It's 4147-2023-4763-0848. Got it. Thank you so much. And how about your billing zip code? CEDO237. All right. Thank you. And, yes, I have your account pull up here. This is for your Chase Alpha Reserve with Ultimate Rewards. How about the trip I gave the reservation? Yeah. That is Q7SM69GST. All right. Thank you. I think I found it. This is for two passengers. The airline is Lufthansa German Airlines departure from Denver leaving August 31st of 2022. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Let me check the notes here. I can see a lot of notes. Yeah. Hold on. Yeah.

 All right, I can see the notes here. This is last September that you called us and actually let me double check. They also gave you the number of our benefits team. Is that right? For the trip protection. Did you call the benefits team about this one? I don't know the difference. Sorry. Okay. So you haven't called the benefits team or actually we have different departments called the benefits team. Did you already call them? No. Okay, let me check here. Let me see. What team is this? I'm sorry. What team are you on? Oh, we are from the help desk. Okay. Yeah, so I'm sure I can hear the three help desk representatives that you have been talked to before that they gave you the benefits number to call and to see about the trip protection about this flight. So let me check here. Okay. I don't recall. Can I not? Yes, I will find the number of the benefits team and let me see what are the options. Okay. I just want to make sure right now you are waiting for a refund of this reservation. Not exactly. It's a refund for all the costs we incurred because of this delay, as well as compensation that they owe us because of the European law when there's significant delays. Okay. Yeah, I think that's why the help desk representative gave you the benefits team number for the trip protection if they can give you a compensation about the delay of the flight. So yeah, let me find their number here. Okay, they just transferred me here to you.

 Yeah, actually that is our front line and they transferred to the Helpdesk and upon checking on the notes here, the Helpdesk representative give you the options to call the Benefits Team. Yeah, bear with me. All right, I better be able to find their number. I will transfer the call to them to make sure and I will explain what happened. Okay, that will be great. Thank you. Yes, you are always welcome. Yeah, and by the way, before I contact them, can I ask for your call back number in case this line got disconnected, I can call you back. Yeah, it is 650-784-1401. All right, just to make sure, 650-784-1401. Yeah. All right, thank you so much. Yeah, I will contact our Benefits Team and I will get back to you as soon as possible. Okay, hold on. You are welcome.
