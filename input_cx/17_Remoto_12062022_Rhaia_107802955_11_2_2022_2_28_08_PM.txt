 Hello, I'm calling Travel Help Desk. Hi there, thank you for calling Travel Help Desk. My name is Raya, a supervisor. How can I help you today? Yeah, so Raya, I have here a customer named Erica Richter, an authorized redeemer, who wants to speak with a supervisor due to the reason that he wants to address the amount of the price of the fare that he just booked today. I tried to offer to cancel so that she can book it with UA, but he doesn't want to cancel. He only wants to adjust it. She mentioned that the price on the United Airlines website is different from our price. So UA website has lower price than us. I said that it's not always the same and fares and availabilities are not guaranteed unless we are ticketed, but the customer is insisting on adjusting it. She also said that he, I think she done it before. I don't know if it was adjusted. So can you please help me with the customer? I tried my best to escalate this, but she's asking for a suit.

And you mentioned that you have the authorized redeemer on the other line. Just to confirm, is this a new booking or an existing reservation? Do you want to exchange? An existing reservation. She doesn't want to exchange or something. She just wants us to adjust it for her. The price of the tickets. According to what she sees on the United Airlines website. She said that we should not be, like, we should not post the price higher than what she can see on the United Airlines website.

140.75--267.0

Okay, may I know the card number and the zip code please? Uh, yeah. So, um, are you ready? Sure thing. Okay, so the number would be... Okay. The zip code please. Um, zip code is... Thank you.

JSAF, our preferred account, and we have two travelers. Uh, United Airlines departing December 21st from EWR to TPA and return still with United Airlines December 26th, TPA back to EWR. Yes, that's correct. Okay, Monday, December 26th. Okay. And you did let the authorizer, Timmer, know that tours and availabilities are not guaranteed, correct? Yes, that's correct. I always, always tell the customer, but the customer still did not acknowledge that.
SPEAKER_01
269.75--295.9
 If you're ready you can go ahead and introduce me. My name is Raya. Okay, thank you Raya. I will let the customer join now. Hello, Ms. Richter. So I have here Raya, one of our online supervisors who will be assisting you onwards. So I will be excusing myself now. So thank you and have a wonderful day for the both of you. Thank you. Thank you.
SPEAKER_01
297.05--305.8
 Thank you so much, Cass. Good morning and you're calling travel help desk. My name is Raya, one of the supervisors. May I know your name, please?
SPEAKER_00
306.75--307.5
 Hi Ryan, thanks for watching!
SPEAKER_01
307.5--320.9
 Thank you so much Ms. Richard. And if I understand correctly, Kath mentioned that you have an existing reservation. You had questions about the price, is that right?
SPEAKER_00
322.25--379.3
 Yeah, so this has happened to me before where for some reason Chase is not showing the same price as the flight directly through the company. So in this particular case, the flight is being shown and what I paid being $537.20 per person, whereas the flight on United's website is listed at $521.25 per person. In the past when I've seen this and I've brought this to Chase's attention, they have always honored the price of the airline. And the website.
SPEAKER_01
379.3--453.0
 Okay, thank you so much for letting me know, Ms. Richard. Actually, I'm looking at the reservation right now. I see it's a United Airlines round trip flight, Wednesday, December 21st departing Newark, going to Tampa, and then Monday, December 26th, returning from Tampa to Newark. Is that right? Correct. Correct. Thank you so much for confirming. So we do let our members know that fares and availabilities are not guaranteed until ticketed before they are reserved or before we make the reservation. And we do have to let you know that we do not price match with the airlines website. So for this particular thing, I do want to let you know that what we have or what our prices are is going to be exactly what we have here and what the United Airlines website prices would be for their own customers. So they would reserve the prices, the best prices for their own customers who will be booking on their website.
SPEAKER_00
453.0--479.6
 I mean, I've never heard of another travel site not having the same price as the airline itself. It's always the same. Never cheaper, never more expensive. It is always one for one. So I don't understand why in this particular case you guys are showing the price is higher than it would be through United. I don't understand why you guys are showing the price. I mean, it's always the same. I don't understand why in this particular case you guys are showing the price is higher than it would be through United. It is always the same. Never cheaper, never more expensive. It is always the same.
SPEAKER_01
479.6--531.4
 Actually, it's been like that for as long as I can remember. I've been here for a year now, and we have the same roles as when I started. So basically, I don't actually see or understand as well how you were able to actually get the same price from the airline's website price match to what we have here. But what I'm saying is that right now, we are not going to be able to price match the reservation prices here compared to the airline's website. What we can do is we can go ahead and book you on another reservation, and then you can use the airline's website for that new reservation. But for this existing one, we are not able to do a price match.
SPEAKER_00
532.75--538.5
 So you're saying that if I were to cancel this and rebook it, then you would price match it? I'm confused.
SPEAKER_01
539.95--581.1
 No, Ms. Richer, we can try to check the cancellation rules if it's possible to cancel this with a refund, but we are not still going to be able to price match what the United Airlines website has. Again, they do save the best prices for their own customers on their website, so that actually usually happens even if you also go to American Airlines website. For example, they will have better prices on some of the seats because they reserve those for their own customers.
SPEAKER_00
583.05--606.3
 Okay, I mean this is the first time I've ever heard this. Like I said, I've purchased tickets through Chase Ultimate for awards travel before, and in the past, maybe not in the past year, because who, I haven't traveled in the past year. You know, it has always been, oh my god we're so sorry, we don't know why it's showing differently.
SPEAKER_01
606.3--628.9
 I definitely understand where you're coming from Ms. Richard. But yeah, since I've been here, I think that's September of last year, it's always been the same that we are not able to price match the United Airlines or any airline's website prices compared to what we have here.
SPEAKER_00
630.55--652.3
 Well, why would your prices be any different? Why would your prices be more expensive? I mean, I've never heard of any website being more expensive. I mean, if I go on Annex, it's not going to be more expensive. If I go on any other third party, like an Expedia or something else, it's not going to be more expensive. It's going to be exactly the same.
SPEAKER_00
653.05--653.3
 Thank you.
SPEAKER_01
653.3--685.1
 It's not essentially always more expensive, Mr. Sir, but instead we do have different prices compared to the airlines because we coordinate those prices with them or sometimes, for example, we would buy them in bulk. So they give us different prices for different seats and different kinds of classes. So that's where the prices differ, but it's not essentially always higher with us.
SPEAKER_00
687.25--695.0
 No, I know it's not. Usually it's the same. That's why I'm confused as to why it's now higher in this particular case.
SPEAKER_01
695.95--712.0
 Yeah, there are some instances that we get the higher prices and sometimes the airlines provide better prices on the website. But yeah, since we are not able to ask for it right now.
SPEAKER_00
712.0--715.1
 There's absolutely nothing case can do about this.
SPEAKER_01
715.85--742.3
 right now I really apologize miss Richard but yeah the airline does this preserves its better prices for its own website I mean for its own website customers so what we have for options here is we can check on the ferals of your reservation for exchange or cancellations options but for I don't want to do that
SPEAKER_01
742.85--748.7
 Okay. All right. I'm really sorry, but for price matching, we're not going to be able to do that today.
SPEAKER_00
749.75--750.6
 Okay, thank you.
SPEAKER_01
751.65--755.8
 You're welcome, Ms. Richard. Anything else I can assist you with today?
SPEAKER_00
756.85--757.5
 No, that's not.
SPEAKER_01
759.55--776.0
