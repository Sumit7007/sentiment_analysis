 Hi, I have a car reservation originally supposed to be picked up today. We were not able to make the flight and so we would like to cancel this reservation. I was on the phone with you guys a few minutes ago trying to cancel this. One of the representatives on your end told me that the cancellation cannot be done because it's within, you know, because the reservation is for today and you guys cannot cancel it on your end and told me to call Dollar Tree directly. I called Dollar Tree directly and now they're telling me that they cannot cancel it on their end and I have to call you guys back and you guys need to call them directly to handle this cancellation. So here I am calling back.

 Okay.

 The pick up date will be today, that's November 19th. And she already speaks to a previous agent that for her to cancel the reservation, she advised that she should contact the car rental company. But when she speaks to the car rental company, they said that they don't have the visibility under and because they booked the reservation with us.
SPEAKER_03
608.25--617.0
 to the customer it's interesting that she wants to cancel this one because um their flight was cancelled so they they won't need this car anymore

If they actually really want to cancel this one, they're supposed to be calling this much earlier or before the pick up time. But yeah, you can just transfer this. Thank you so much.
