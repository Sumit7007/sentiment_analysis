SPEAKER_05
70.35--78.9
 Thank you so much for this information. And is this your, all right, so is this the only reservation you need assistance with?
SPEAKER_01
78.9--135.8
 So this reservation is not valid because the flight which was supposed to have left VWI is indefinitely delayed and our connecting flight from Columbus has departed already so I think Southwest cancels that itinerary the booking because we don't have any more available airlines or flights from VWI. That being said, I was working with one of your agents to get a reservation for the 27th from VWI to Houston with a layover in Atlanta. It almost went through, she got an error and after that she transferred to some department which is more than somebody else. That call did not go through and I'm left with no reservation and no solution for my travel.
