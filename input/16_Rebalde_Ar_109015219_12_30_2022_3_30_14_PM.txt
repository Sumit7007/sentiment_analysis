SPEAKER_02
646.45--648.5
 Hello? Oh yeah.
SPEAKER_02
649.15--689.3
 Yes, thank you for patiently waiting here. As I have checked here with your reservation, Ms. Merchant, is that sadly, it shows here that the reservation, it is a nonrefundable and also changes is not permitted. So it means it is not eligible for any travel product or flight product. It is because as I've checked here, the one that you have chosen is the most restrictive plus, the basic economy. And as much as I would like to proceed to cancel here, our system will not allow us to, since we are only a third party here and we only follow the airline's policy.
SPEAKER_01
690.05--697.3
 Can you cancel this again? So that way if somebody else needs to book it, they can at least book it. So like, yeah, but it's about to call a cancel.
SPEAKER_02
698.65--701.6
 Oh, you mean change.
SPEAKER_01
701.6--709.4
 I'm not going to be on the flight because it's peak holiday season and so I know that other people might be waiting to buy us seats.
SPEAKER_02
712.25--717.9
 Well, you just want to cancel this reservation without getting any refund.
SPEAKER_01
719.25--721.1
 Yeah, that's fine. What else do I do?
SPEAKER_02
722.05--726.4
 Well, you can try to request it through the American Airlines if you want.
SPEAKER_01
727.85--729.3
 I'd like to identify.
SPEAKER_02
729.3--745.6
 Yes, you can try to request to American Airlines if they will approve a request of cancellations since you were not able to take your outbound flight here since the Salchow's Airlines cancelled their flight. You can try to request it through them if you want.
SPEAKER_01
745.6--747.8
 Okay.
SPEAKER_02
747.8--752.0
 Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Is there anything else that can help with?
