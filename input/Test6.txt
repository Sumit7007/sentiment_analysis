SPEAKER_00
725.65--730.4
 Oh my goodness me. Oklahoma at least did not buy any of the storms.
SPEAKER_01
730.4--741.7
 Well yes, that's a good thing. It's a great thing, but I just feel so bad for the people that are over there by the storms. I know some of them are used to it, but still the devastation has to be horrific.
SPEAKER_00
741.7--748.7
 It's crazy. It is. It really is. Will you be safe and thank you for your patience.
SPEAKER_01
748.7--757.9
