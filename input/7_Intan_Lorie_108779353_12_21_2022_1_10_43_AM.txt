 No, you got it. I just want to make sure I have two flights on that day. One, I just made a new reservation, which is why I'm canceling this one. So do you want to cancel this one? The Southwest, you got it. The 645 a.m. flight, I just want to 100% sure make sure it's the Southwest flight.
SPEAKER_03
192.7--200.7
 Yeah, it's the Southwest flight that I am pulling up. So, yeah, I'm sorry, you want to cancel this slide.
SPEAKER_01

SPEAKER_03

SPEAKER_03
356.75--386.4
 Thank you for patiently waiting, ma'am. I'm sorry. The ticket policy is quite really clear about the cancellation. Is it okay if I'll consult this from our help desk? Can you? Hello, ma'am. Thank you for patiently waiting. Yep. All right. So check the policies here. It's quite unclear with regards to the cancellation. Is it okay if I'll consult this to the help desk and then we'll proceed from there?
SPEAKER_01
386.4--402.1
 Well, I'm going to have a big problem because I was told twice on the phone already that it was 100% refundable to my credit card. Not a certificate, not anything else. I've already been on the phone for 25 minutes.
SPEAKER_01
403.05--414.0
 booking the other flight which supposedly is refundable but if it's not I'm going to be really screwed and I know this isn't your fault but I also talked to two people earlier today.
SPEAKER_03
414.0--420.2
 I know that this is going to be real quick. I'll just need to have it verified.
SPEAKER_01
420.2--426.4
 I'm at the end of my rope. That's not you. I apologize. Thank you.
SPEAKER_03
426.4--428.3
 Okay, you're welcome and stay on the line.
SPEAKER_00
431.25--435.7
 Please listen carefully to for chase press for chase travel call press 1.
SPEAKER_02
442.85--450.7
 Hi, welcome in. Thank you for calling the Chase Ultimate Day Award. My name is Chris. Your travel helped this. Can I have your name please?
SPEAKER_03
451.45--474.5
 Hi Chris, I just wanted to ask how this is Lori. I'm with the front line. I was actually there is a card number on the other line and she wanted to cancel her flight with Southwest. Try to pull up the fare rules. I didn't say specifically about it being refundable. Can you help me?
SPEAKER_02
476.15--484.5
 I will never check the payrolls of the airline. So let's get started first to verify the account. I'm ready to name of the customer.
SPEAKER_03
485.15--508.4
 that's gonna be Catherine Lubingair and I just pulled up the reservation through the trip ID and the details of the flight because I believe she put in her nickname on the account so yeah what else do you think?
SPEAKER_02
509.45--512.1
 I believe it's the trip ID number and the zip code.
SPEAKER_03
512.65--523.9
 Trip ID number is Q for Quebec, Django, Romeo, V for Victor, Hotel, Sierra, Nancy, X-ray.
SPEAKER_03
524.55--525.3
 Charlie.
SPEAKER_02
527.45--541.1
 All right, let me go ahead and pull up the reservation. So, I'll be placing the call on the hub for about one to two minutes. You can update the customer, okay? I have the variables. Thank you. Sure.
SPEAKER_03
546.05--565.4
 Hello, Ms. Katie. All right, so yes, ma'am, stay on the line. I'm now talking to Chris, one of our supervisors. So he's currently checking the details and then we can proceed with the cancellation, okay?
SPEAKER_01
565.4--597.8
 I will tell you if it's helpful that I'm on the Southwest flight, I'm on the Southwest website, I can click the cancel button there and then it says, upon cancellation, any travel funds will only be available through the travel manager who booked the reservation on your behalf, which I assume is you. Please contact your travel manager for an email confirmation and further information regarding these funds. So I will do it through Southwest if you direct me to, but obviously I just wanted to offer more information.
SPEAKER_03
597.8--604.6
 Alright, thank you so much for that ma'am. So yeah, that's very helpful. I'm going to inform Chris also about that, okay?
SPEAKER_01
606.25--608.8
 And are you there? Yes.
SPEAKER_01
609.65--624.8
 Sorry, to be clear, I have two flights on Southwest. I booked them separately. I only want the Boise to Orlando. I do not want the Orlando returning to Boise, but I booked them separately. I have two for confirmation.
SPEAKER_03
625.55--632.3
 That's the trip ID you provided earlier, right? But
SPEAKER_01
633.95--637.5
 Well, let's be sure.
SPEAKER_03
637.5--640.1
 Forneredcolo.
SPEAKER_01
640.1--657.4
 Let me, right, but you have a different number than Southwest does and so that's my concern. Bear with me because it keeps logging me out of the account so I have to get it back into the account and see.
SPEAKER_03
657.4--663.9
 Boise to Orlando, right? Scheduled on the 23rd. So this is the one that you want to cancel, am I right?
SPEAKER_01
663.9--668.6
 Yep, I just don't want to cancel the one coming back.
SPEAKER_03
668.6--669.8
 This is the one that I have met.
SPEAKER_01
670.45--676.2
 Okay, I just need to make sure because I don't have a slide to come up. I'm really up a creek.
SPEAKER_03
676.2--680.9
 Yeah, Boise to Orlando once again, right?
SPEAKER_01
681.65--683.8
 Yep, Boise to Orlando.
SPEAKER_03
683.8--706.0
 Stay on the light move.
SPEAKER_02
706.05--709.9
 Hi, thank you for patiently waiting on the line for me.
SPEAKER_03
710.95--711.6
 I am.
SPEAKER_02
712.75--726.9
 Alright, so as per sharing the girl actually, um, is that clear? If the state has been refundable or not? So, let me just go ahead and take over the call because we have the concept earlier and just confirm they are valid.
SPEAKER_03
727.65--735.0
 Thank you so much Chris. I'll introduce you to Katie. She wants to be called Katie. Ok bye

Thank you once again, ma'am, for calling the Ultimate Rewards Travel Center. And Chris, thank you for taking over the call, sir. You both have a great day. I'll excuse myself. Bye-bye.
SPEAKER_02

 Hi, I'm Miss Katie. How are you doing today?
SPEAKER_01
764.6--768.2
 Okay, just getting frustrated.
SPEAKER_02
768.2--781.6
 Sorry to hear about that one. But everybody, Ms. Chris, a lot of this is a provider hearing case. And according to you, Michael, that you are planning to cancel your flight reservation, operated by Southwest Airlines, correct?
SPEAKER_01

 Correct.
