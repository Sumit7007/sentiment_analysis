 Hello, I'm Zyxson. Yes, I'm here. Thank you so much for waiting. Just a quick, really fast update. I'm still working on getting the fair rules. It shows that it does qualify for a credit. I just need to confirm with one of our travel specialists. Is it okay if I place you on another report for about two or three minutes and I'll be right back.

 Hello,Zixn.
SPEAKER_01
596.35--597.2
 Yes, I'm here.
SPEAKER_00
597.85--616.5
 Thank you so much for patient and waiting. Okay, so yes, I was able to confirm it shows that it does qualify for a credit So we can cancel the reservation and apply that credit. You will have a whole year to use it I just need to confirm. Are we going to cancel the flight for both passengers for more critics in and Terry John picket?
SPEAKER_01
617.75--644.7
 Yes, and then I do have to mention that the Southwest New World is that the credit never expires. So is it only because, is it because, I'm sorry hold on, do I only have a year to use the travel credit because I've looked your chase travel? Because if I cancel through Southwest there's no expiration date while I'm using the travel credit. Which is fine because I'm going to use it before in a year anyway. But I'm just wondering.
SPEAKER_00
645.85--680.7
 As of right now, yes, that's what we have from the airline, the fare rules from them. We haven't received any update, but I will go ahead and check on it. I will notate the account, but as of right now, that's what we have on the rules. Okay. Okay, so let me go ahead and then continue with the cancellation. We'll start with the cancellation to apply the credit. I just want to confirm we will be canceling the flight from recruiter Al Dixon and Terry John Piquette from Miami to Chicago for Wednesday, December 21st, 2022.
SPEAKER_01
681.75--689.8
 And where do I find the site credit? Do I have to book it through you guys to use the credit, or can I book it through Southwest? I wouldn't know what, it's Southwest.
SPEAKER_00
691.55--705.2
 It will be stored with them, yes, since the credits would be airline, but they will recommend the reservation with me through Chase, through us for you to book through us, with us to read book.
SPEAKER_01
706.65--712.5
 So I can't read booklets, I have to read booklets, hey? The most interesting information one could get information, not of anything.
SPEAKER_00
712.5--747.8
 Okay, that's fine. Okay, also I wanna advise you that once we cancel the reservation, there's no way to restore the same exact one. If you have to rebook the same one, you will have to be at current first and availability. Okay. Okay, also another thing, the credit can only be used for the original passengers, it cannot be changed or transferred. Okay. Okay, so let me go ahead and then cancel the flight and apply the credit, if you can just give me about a minute on the line.
SPEAKER_01
749.15--749.5
 Okay.
SPEAKER_02
756.45--756.9
 Okay.
SPEAKER_00
