SPEAKER_02
394.5--396.2
 Thanks for watching!
SPEAKER_01
401.05--406.2
 For some reason that hotel is not coming up but I'm looking still.
SPEAKER_03
411.35--416.5
 because what this might have is showing availability for today.
SPEAKER_03
417.15--428.6
 It might be easier if you study by the city and it would be one of the top in the list maybe.
SPEAKER_01
429.35--438.5
 I'm looking actually that way. I didn't put the name in because it wasn't coming up. So I'm just listening individually with the name Atlanta, Georgia.
SPEAKER_02
449.25--450.0
 Thank you.
SPEAKER_03
450.0--450.5

SPEAKER_01
450.65--452.3
 Uh-huh. Go ahead.
SPEAKER_03
452.3--462.5
 The way I found it, I searched my Santa and then it filtered by a triple Pfizer rating of 4 stars and higher.
SPEAKER_02
462.65--462.8
 you
SPEAKER_01
462.8--463.6
 Okay.
SPEAKER_03
463.6--467.8
 and I sorted by price from low to high.
SPEAKER_01
468.55--478.7
 Okay, got it. Let me see what comes up when I do that. And the price was how much was it showing you?
SPEAKER_03
480.55--483.9
 That was 83, I think 83 dollars.
SPEAKER_01
483.9--485.9
 Oh, maybe three.
SPEAKER_01
487.15--528.0
 Thank you for telling me that it helps me with my search. The only problem is that it's for today so sometimes it might show but then it might not be available. But I'm still looking on here.
SPEAKER_03
528.95--543.8
 Yeah, I mean, if you thought by the rank and four stars and higher and the price, you can tell me what do you see and I can show the difference, lots of different worlds.
SPEAKER_01
543.85--546.2
 Oh, okay, sure.
SPEAKER_02
566.45--567.0
 Thank you.
SPEAKER_01
570.15--586.1
 So for today, if I do a four star rating plus say within $100 for the hotel, on my search there is nothing, everything is sold out. That's four star within $100.
SPEAKER_03
586.75--594.3
 I think you may be choosing 4-star as a 4-star bottle, but what I meant...
SPEAKER_03
594.95--603.4
 uh first star on trip advisor it should be it should be when you when you look up the filters it should be the one lower than that
SPEAKER_01
603.55--606.2
 Okay, got it. I'm looking.
SPEAKER_03
606.65--609.9
 Yes, that would use more ability for star not
SPEAKER_01
609.9--630.8
 I will find it. Oh, okay. Got it. Got it. Now I probably will find it. Yep, I found it. No, I can't read. So Masters and Tucker, this one is showing $66 per night. For one night.
SPEAKER_01
632.55--636.6
 Let me click on this and see what kind of room would you like?
SPEAKER_03
638.55--648.9
 Is this the same fossil we discussed in the beginning? Yeah. The musters? Yeah. So I'm looking for a gang bedroom, not smoking.
SPEAKER_01
648.901--673.1
 Okay, king bedroom, non-smoke. Okay, so I have standard room, one king bed, non-smoke.
SPEAKER_03
674.45--675.3

SPEAKER_01
733.85--749.0

SPEAKER_03
749.0--749.5

SPEAKER_03
1151.05--1159.1
 Well, thank you so much for helping with that. My remaining question is, do you happen to know why I can't do it in the house?
SPEAKER_01
1159.55--1211.8
 So basically there is a reason. So there is a screening based on name and what the database, our database goes through. There's extra screening that you have to go through. You're on that list. And so if you want to take off your name, it's all done through the US Department of Treasury. And you would have to go through screening. You have to go through the screening until you remove your name from that list, basically, which is a form filled with the US Treasury. And you can Google that. And then you have to file a petition for removal from the list through the Treasury, basically.
SPEAKER_03
1213.15--1217.9
 Doesn't have to do anything to do with someone having a similar name to me.
SPEAKER_01
1217.9--1242.6
 Correct, it could be possibly, you know, a lot of people do in the world, we have similar names. And it's through the government website, US Department of Treasury. So I know that's a pain, every time you try to book you can't, so you would have to remove your name and you would have to fill out the form through the US Treasury basically.
SPEAKER_03
1243.25--1250.0
 Okay, I see. And it doesn't show you what name is similar to me by any chance, does it?
SPEAKER_01
1250.15--1256.4
 No, it's just your name. However it is, we put your name and that's what comes up. So that's why.
SPEAKER_03
1256.4--1261.3
 Okay, yeah, I will reach out to them and see what I can do about that.
SPEAKER_01
1261.3--1269.5
 Yeah, if you just Google it, then it'll take you and tell you what form to fill out, and then you can file a petition to remove that. And then you should be good.
SPEAKER_03
1270.35--1272.3
 Okay, thank you so much.
